# Pupillometry
Pupillometry preprocessing and analysis based on the study "Sensory suppression and increased neuromodulation during actions disrupt memory encoding of unpredictable self-initiated stimuli" on bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.15.472750

The analyses were largely based on Urai et al. (2017), https://github.com/anne-urai, using Fieldtrip https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/
